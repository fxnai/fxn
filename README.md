# Function for Python and CLI

![function logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxnai/.github/main/logo_wide.png)

Run AI prediction functions (a.k.a "predictors") in your Python apps. With Function, you can build AI-powered apps by creating and composing GPU-accelerated predictors that run in the cloud. In a few steps:

## Installing Function
Function is distributed on PyPi. This distribution contains both the Python client and the command line interface (CLI). To install, open a terminal and run the following command:
```sh
pip install --upgrade fxn
```

> Note that Function requires Python 3.9+

## Making a Prediction
Let's run the [`@samplefxn/stable-diffusion`](https://fxn.ai/@samplefxn/stable-diffusion) predictor which accepts a text `prompt` and generates a corresponding image.

### In Python
Run the following Python script:
```py
import fxn

prediction = fxn.Prediction.create(
    tag="@samplefxn/stable-diffusion",
    prompt="An astronaut riding a horse on Mars"
)
image = prediction.results[0]
image.show()
```

### In the CLI
Open up a terminal and run the following command:

```sh
fxn predict @samplefxn/stable-diffusion --prompt "An astronaut riding a horse on the moon"
```

Within a few seconds, you should see a creepy-looking image pop up ðŸ˜…:

## Creating a Predictor
At some point, you might want to create your own predictor. With Function, you don't have to deal with GitHub repos, Dockerfiles, or weird YAMLs. All you need is a Jupyter Notebook with a `predict` function. See our [samples project](https://github.com/fxnai/samples) for more.
